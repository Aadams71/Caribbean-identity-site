        <h2>Essay</h2>
        <p>Agrillo Adams</p><p>Professor Anna Barattin</p><p>ENGL 1102</p><p>21 April 2025</p><p>Sustaining Culture: Caribbean Identity Through Food and Language in Atlanta</p><p>Atlanta, Georgia, is home to a vibrant Caribbean immigrant population. Within this community, cultural identity is preserved through stories, traditions, food, and language. This paper explores how Caribbean immigrants specifically Jamaican and Guyanese maintain their cultural roots through traditional food practices and linguistic expressions. Drawing from interviews with Clayton Anderson, a Jamaican contractor, and the owner of TS Bakery, a Guyanese restaurant and grocery store, as well as scholarly research, this ethnographic study reveals how everyday acts like cooking curry goat or speaking patois are more than habits they are acts of cultural preservation.</p><p>Clayton Anderson, a Jamaican immigrant who has lived in Atlanta for over two decades, shared in an interview that cooking jerk chicken reminds him of his father, who taught him how to season it just right with thyme, scotch bonnet pepper, and allspice. When speaking about food, Clayton often slipped into Jamaican Patois, referring to dishes like "ackee and saltfish" or phrases like "mi deh yah," underscoring how language and food are inseparable in preserving identity. Clayton emphasized that while he’s adapted to American life, he never let go of the way he spoke or ate, because those practices connect him to home.</p><p>At TS Bakery, the smell of fresh bake, pepperpot, and dhal puri fills the air. The Guyanese owner, who requested anonymity, proudly displayed products imported from Georgetown: curry powder blends, cassareep, and tamarind chutney. She explained that many of her customers are second-generation Caribbean Americans who come to the store for a taste of home and to hear their parents' dialects spoken aloud. During my visit, I observed customers using Creole expressions, casually asking for "channa" or "metemgee," all while connecting with each other in a shared cultural space. This experience reinforced the idea that food businesses like T’s Bakery are cultural hubs, preserving language and tradition simultaneously.</p><p>During our conversation, she also reflected on her childhood memories of watching her mother prepare pepperpot for Christmas and how she now shares that recipe with her grandchildren. This generational passing of knowledge keeps the language and flavor alive. For many Caribbean families, these recipes are not written down but spoken, demonstrating how language and food intertwine in everyday life.</p><p>One young customer, who identified as Jamaican-American, mentioned that his mother insists on speaking to him in Patois when they cook together. It’s not just about learning a recipe, he explained, but about “getting the feeling right.” These conversations around cooking are full of slang, sayings, and cultural references that can’t be translated easily. He admitted that he often switches to Patois himself when preparing certain meals because, as he said, “it just feels more real.”</p><p>Scholarly research supports these observations. In *Food and Identity in the Caribbean*, anthropologist Hanna Garth explains how culinary practices define cultural borders and express identity in diasporic contexts. Similarly, Sharma et al. (2018) examined dietary patterns among Jamaican immigrants in Florida and found that traditional foods served as a meaningful connection to cultural heritage. In another study, Thompson and colleagues (2024) explored food sharing practices among Caribbean families, emphasizing how these exchanges preserve intergenerational bonds and linguistic traditions.</p><p>As a researcher and observer in this project, I found myself personally moved by the commitment these individuals have to their roots. I began reflecting on how food in my own household carries its own traditions and how language shapes the way we pass down those customs and at times maintain family bonds. Whether it’s seasoning meat, preparing a stew, or baking bread, each dish tells a story.</p><p>This process of documentation also made me realize that cultural preservation is not a passive act; it’s intentional. It’s choosing to cook oxtail instead of spaghetti even though I enjoy spaghetti, it just feels better making something my mother taught me. It’s choosing to speak Patois when English would be easier. It’s deciding to open a bakery that sells black cake and doubles instead of cupcakes. These choices are everyday declarations of cultural pride.</p><p>In conclusion, traditional food and West Indian language expressions are powerful tools Caribbean immigrants use to sustain their identity in Atlanta. Whether it’s through a contractor like Clayton Anderson keeping Patois alive, or a business like T’s Bakery offering not just meals but cultural connection, these everyday interactions tell a larger story. It’s one of belonging, pride, and community building that transcends borders and generations.</p><p>Keywords: Caribbean, identity, food practices, language, cultural preservation</p><p>Works Cited</p><p>Garth, Hanna, editor. *Food and Identity in the Caribbean*.
